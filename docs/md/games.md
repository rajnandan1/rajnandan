## History

I always loved playing video games. I remember the first time when I saw a game being played on a computer. There was this person as a tenant in our house. I was probably 9 years old (3rd standard)

## My first video games

I remember he used to click on a yellow Icon and there would be two different icons on the screen. I later discovered that yellow icon was called a folder.

On his computer I played
