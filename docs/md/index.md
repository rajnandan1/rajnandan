# About me

<img src="/assets/images/me.jpg" style="widht: 60px;height:60px;border-radius:30px;filter: grayscale(100%);">

Hello everyone! I am Raj Nandan Sharma (<span id="age"></span> years old).

Here are few things about me:

- I have been writing code to build something meaningful to me since 2012. 
- I have built softwares that are being used by millions of users.
- Currently I am writing code in Go, Svelte and NodeJS
- I don't like cognitive overload, I like to keep things simple and minimal.
- Currently I am working at [Cashfree Payments](https://cashfree.com) as an Associate Director of Engineering, Bengaluru, India.
- One of my alias is purplewow. WOW from World of Warcraft. Loved every bit of [DOTA](https://www.dota2.com/home).
- I like souls-like games.
- Personal Projects that I am working on can be found  [here](/projects)
- Knack for good UX and UI. It is perfect if there is nothing left to be removed from a design.
