Hello everyone! I am Raj Nandan Sharma (<span id="age"></span> years old).

I have been writing code since 2012, building software used by millions of users.
Currently, I code in Go, Svelte, and NodeJS, and I prefer simplicity and minimalism. I work at [Cashfree Payments](https://cashfree.com) as an Associate Director of Engineering in Bengaluru, India.
Known as purplewow, inspired by World of Warcraft, I enjoy DOTA and souls-like games.
I have a keen eye for good UX and UI, believing that perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to remove from a design.
