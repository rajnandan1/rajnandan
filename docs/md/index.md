Hello everyone! I am Raj Nandan Sharma (<span id="age"></span> years old).

I have been writing code since 2012. To me writing code relaxes me, I mostly code in Go, Svelte, and NodeJS. I prefer simplicity and minimalism in both code and design. I have built software used by millions of users.

I work at [Cashfree Payments](https://cashfree.com) as an Associate Director of Engineering in Bengaluru, India.

I also indulge in gaming from time to time. My online alias is purplewow. I used to do multi player gaming, but now I mostly play single player games. I love souls-like games.

I have a keen eye for good UX and UI, believing that perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to remove from a design.
